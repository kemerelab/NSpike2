See the INSTALL file for installation details.

If dependencies change, run "autogen.sh" to regenerate configure
script from "configure.ac" and "Makefile.am" (and src-directory
"Makefile.am" files).

To create a distributable tar file, run "make dist". If files are
added or removed, make sure that everything is updated so that
this still works!!!
