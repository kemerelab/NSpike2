Compiling:
1. run "./configure" 
    (perhaps with the --bindir=/usr/local/nspike option)
    (perhaps with the --enable-nspike-fixpos=true option)

2. run "cd src-gui; qmake; cd .." (to generate QT specific files)
  NOTE: if you are on certain systems (e.g., Mandriva), it seems
  that setting update-alternatives with co-installations of qt3
  and qt4 does not propagate all necessary environmental
  variables. So, you'll need to run:
  "export "QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3"; qmake", where "/usr/lib/qt3" is
  the directory of the qt3 installation as reported by the
  configure script.

3. run "make"

4. run "make install" (to install binaries into PATH)

5. optionally, copy "nspikecalfile" and "nspike_rgbcolor" from
    "data/" into "/usr/local/nspike"
