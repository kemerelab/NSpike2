Overview:

The MainDSP can be fitted with up to 64 TTL-compatible digital I/Os, 
configured in 4 "ports" of 16 bits.  Each port can be configured as an 
input or output.  Outputs levels can be set directly by writing to the 
DigOut memory locations described below, or by programming the Output 
State Machine to set and clear outputs after changes in digital inputs 
or programmed time delays.  Inputs can be read from the DigIn memory 
locations, or the user can program the MainDSP to send a UDP packet in 
response to a change in selected digital inputs.

DigOutEnable  (0x0000D9)
bit 0 set to 1 to enable bits 1-16 for output, set to 0 for input.
bit 1 set to 1 to enable bits 17-32 for output, set to 0 for input.
bit 2 set to 1 to enable bits 33-48 for output, set to 0 for input.
bit 3 set to 1 to enable bits 49-64 for output, set to 0 for input.
Defaults to 0x0000 (all inputs)

DigOut(n) directly control the digital output pins.
When the state machine is enabled, and updates output bits or words, it 
first writes them to these memory locations.  Background code then 
transfers them to the digital IO hardware.  Thus, these locations can be 
monitored to track the status of the state machine.  Note that state 
machine instructions which update single bits do not affect the other 
bits in the DigOut registers.

DigOut1            (0x0000DA)  output bits 1-16
DigOut2            (0x0000DB)   output bits 17-32
DigOut3            (0x0000DC)   output bits 33-48
DigOut4            (0x0000DD)   output bits 49-64

DigIn(n) are the current state of the digital inputs.
DigIn1            (0x0000DE)   input bits 1-16
DigIn2            (0x0000DF)   input bits 17-32
DigIn3            (0x0000E0)   input bits 33-48
DigIn4            (0x0000E1)   input bits 49-64

--------- OUTPUT STATE MACHINE -----------------------

SMEnableFlag (0x0000ED)
When bit 0 is set to 1, the DSP code runs the output state machine.

State Machine Buffer
StateMachineBuffer0 (0x000200)
StateMachineBuffer1 (0x000240)
StateMachineBuffer2 (0x000280)
StateMachineBuffer3 (0x0002C0)

StateMachinePtr0 (0x0000F0)
Pointer to currently executed instruction in the state machine buffer, 
relative to the beginning of the buffer.  Range is 0x0000 to 0x00FF.  
User may change this value to force the state machine to execute from a 
specific instruction, or read it to monitor the progress of the state 
machine.
StateMachinePtr1 (0x0000F3)
StateMachinePtr2 (0x0000F6)
StateMachinePtr3 (0x0000F9)

FreeStateMachine (0x0000E7) The number of the next free state machine (-1 if
	none are free)


For the following commands,
 BBBBBB is the address of the selected bit.  000000 corresponds to bit 
1, 111111 corresponds to bit 64.
PP is the output port.  00 = bits 1-16, 01 = bits 17-32, etc.

;commands (binary):
;11111111 11111111 = wait forever (halt)
;1TTTTTTT TTTTTTTT = wait for T samples.  Max = 32767 samples (1.09 seconds)
;0111xxxx xxxxxxxx = wait for absolute time
    This is followed by 2 argument words: the high word of the timestamp
    and the low word of the timestamp.  Sorry about the flipped endian 
word order.
;0110xxxx xxxxxxxx = wait for masked input change (see below)
;0100xxx1 xxBBBBBB = wait for input B to go high
;0100xxx0 xxBBBBBB = wait for input B to go low
;0011xxx1 xxBBBBBB = set output B to 1
;0011xxx0 xxBBBBBB = set output B to 0
;0010xxxx xxxxxxPP = set port P to argument word
;00000001 AAAAAAAA = jump absolute.  AAAAAAAA is added to the start 
location of the state machine buffer, and the result is written to the 
state machine pointer.
;00000000 AAAAAAAA = jump relative.  AAAAAAAA is added to the current 
pointer location, the result is masked to leave only the low 8 bits, and 
then it is added to the start location of the state machine buffer, and 
written to the state machine pointer.  Thus, of AAAAAAAA = 11111111, the 
pointer will be decremented by 1 location, provided it is not at the 
beginning of the buffer.

---------- INPUT INTERRUPTS -----------------------

DigIn(n)Mask are the interrupt masks for the digital inputs.  If any 
input whose mask bit is set to 1 changes state, the DSP will send the 
following packet:

;Digin pipeid
;samplecount low
;samplecount high
;port0state
;port1state
;port2state
;port3state

DigIn1Mask        (0x0000E2)
DigIn2Mask        (0x0000E3)
DigIn3Mask        (0x0000E4)
DigIn4Mask        (0x0000E5)
These default to 0 on power-up (no packets sent)

DebounceTime    (0x0000E8)
The digital inputs can be debounced to prevent multiple transitions on 
an input from swamping an ethernet link with packets.  Units are in 
samples.  For a mechanical switch, an appropriate debounce time is on 
the order of 100 msec (3000).

DigInPipeID (0x0000EE) is the pipe ID of the packets sent when the 
digital input changes.
