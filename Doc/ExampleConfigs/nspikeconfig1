% the number of slaves is the number of computers that receive commands from
% the master.  These include normal slaves, the rtslave and, if applicable, the
% matlab slave
nslaves 	0

% the master line gives the name of the master computer and the port for
% connections to the master from each slave.  You may need to
% change the port number if the software complains that it cannot open a
% connection on the specified port.  
% The port numbers must be > 1024 and < 65335
master    	virga    10000

% optional slave lines, one for each slave, would go here


% the port lines give the numbers of ports that the system can use for
% establishing tcpip or udp connections.  Make sure there are at least 20 of
% them (max 100)

% the datatype line specifies the datatype processed on each machine.  Make
% sure to replace the name with the name of your machine

% datatype is a combination of
% SPIKE 
% DIGITALIO
% and
% FSDATA
% or a combination of 
% CONTINUOUS 
% POSITION
% DIGITALIO
% and 
% FSDATA (data to control feedback / stimulation)
% 
% If you want POSITION data, both the master and the rtslave must have POSITION
% as a datatype
%
% Only one machine can have a datatype of DIGITALIO or FSDATA
% 
% e.g.
% datatype	machinename	SPIKE
% datatype	machinename	CONTINOUS 
% datatype	machinename	CONTINOUS POSITION 
% datatype	machinename	CONTINOUS POSITION DIGITALIO

% the data directory specifies the default location for data files on each
% machine.  Note that the Master menu open all files command assumes that the
% same directory exists on all machines. Also note that as the rtlinux machine
% doesn't save data, the datadirectory does not need to be specified for that
% machine.

% the audio settings set the initial gain factor (volume), cutoff for diode
% emulation, and delay in milliseconds.
% the ranges are as follows:
% 0 < gain <= 128
% 0 < cutoff <= 32767
% 0 < delay <= 1000
%	output#	gain	cutoff	delay
audio	0	100	0	0
audio	1	100	0	0

% the dspclock line indicates whether we want to use the external 10 KHz clock
% from the DSPs or the internal counter on the PCI-CTR05 card.  You should only
% use the internal counter if you are taking position and behavior data but not
% taking any electrophysiological data, as otherwise the clocks will not be
% synchronized properly.

dspclock	1

% dspinfo specifies the sampling rate (per channel) and machine names. 
% it can optionally specify the number of samples per packet and the output
% number of samples for each dsp, but these should only be set if you know what
% you are doing
% dsp 0 is the master DSP and should only communicate with the master. As it
% does analog outputs, it will ignore the sampling rate, but make sure to put
% some number in the sampling rate field below
% 	    dsp num   	sampling rate  	machine receiving data

%rtmode is used to improve online analysis.  setting rtmode changes the number of samples per
%packet for continuous channels to produce a data packet every millisecond.  This also causes 
%spike_daq to send out data to spike_fsdata (if it is running) as quickly as possible
%As with dspsampperpacket, don't set this unless you need to minize data latency to spike_fsdata
%rtmode		1

%fsdata defines the types of data to send and the list of electrodes to send to spike_fs_data
%currently each datatype and electrode number need to be listed separately:
% fsdata DIGITALIO
% fsdata POSITION
% fsdata SPIKE 4    this causes spike data from electrode 4 to be sent to spike_fsdata
% fsdata CONTINUOUS 5    this causes continuous data from electrode 5 to be sent to spike_fsdata
fsdata CONTINUOUS 2
fsdata CONTINUOUS 3

%fsgui is the name of the user gui that controls stimulation / real time
%feedback.  This only needs to be defined if you're using it
fsgui stim

% calibration file specifies the name of the calibration file to set the
% relative amplitudes of the channels.  See writecalfile.m for a matlab script
% that generates an example calibration file
calibrationfile		data/nspikecalfile

% set the length (in seconds) of the eeg trace 
eegtracelength 	4.0

% the mapping from electrodes to dsp channels.  This mapping is set by the
% connections from the microdrive array to the A to D box.
% NOTE: the channel numbers and the dsp channels are 0 based but the electrode
% numbers must be 1 based
