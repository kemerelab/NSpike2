Here are the DSP coefficients, with their addresses.  All are shorts
unless specifically described as longs.  The longs are stored with the
low word in the specified address, and the high word in the next address
above it.

Forgive the formatting -- I'm copying and pasting directly from my
assembler source, so as not to introduce any errors.

ResyncCount  .set 0x0000C3 ;keeps track of resynchronization events
This can be read to determine if the DSP box has lost sync with the A/D
box.  I can't remember if I implemented this, but if I didn't, I will,
and here's where the count will live.

DAC0Delay  .set 0x0000CC ;in samples.  max = 16383
DAC1Delay  .set 0x0000CD
This is the delay in samples for the two DAC channels on the master
DSP.  These parameters aren't used by the aux DSPs.

SyncControl  .set 0x0000CF
;BIT0: 0 resets the sample counter, 1 unresets it
;BIT1: 0 stops the sample counter, 1 runs it
;BIT2: 0 resets the 10KHz pulser, 1 runs it
This is only used by the master DSP.  The "sample counter" is the
timestamp, incremented every sample, which the master DSP injects into
channel 127 of the data stream, and which the aux DSPs copy to create
the timestamp info.  On power up, all 3 bits are set, so everything is
running.  The host should briefly (> 10 msec) set these three bits to 0,
then back to 1, to ensure that the DSPs are all synchronized and their
timestamps are reset.


MASTER DSP ONLY:
0x00D1 = DAC0Gain.  Defaults to 256 (unity gain).  
    
    Range = 0 (gain = 0) to 32767 (gain = slightly less than 128)

0x00D2 = DAC1Gain.
0x00D3 = DAC0 Positive Threshold.  Defaults to 0.  Range = 0 (no 
	threshold action) to 32767 (no signals passed).
0x00D4 = DAC0 Negative Threshold.  Defaults to 0.  Range = 0 to -32767
0x00D5 = DAC1 Positive Threshold.
0x00D6 = DAC1 Negative Threshold.


AUX DSP ONLY:

PipeID  .set 0x0000D0
Only on aux DSPs.  This is the first word sent in every Continuous
Packet.  The host PC sets this word to anything it wants, to help it
distinguish the DSPs from each other.

Blocks2Send  .set 0x0000D2
Aux only.  This is the number of UDP packets the host would like the DSP
to send.  The host first sets up the other coeffcients, then makes
Blocks2Send non-zero to start the data transfer.  If this number is
negative, the DSP will keep sending packets until the host sets this
number to 0.  Briefly (for more than 10 msec) setting this number to 0
resets the read pointer in the data buffer to the write pointer.

ChannelsPerSample .set 0x0000D3
Aux only.  The number of active channels in the transfer, corresponding
to the (T) parameter in your spec.  The DSP always sends the first T
channels defined in coefficient memory; in other words, it can't jump
around.

SamplesPerBlock .set 0x0000D4
Aux only.  The number of measurements per channel, what your spec calls
"M".  T*M is the number of data words in each block.

DecimationFactor .set 0x0000D5
Aux only.  1 corresponds to no decimation, 2 is decimation by a factor
of 2, etc.




BOTH DSPS:

;The coefficient buffer stores the coefficients to combine and filter
the
;32 channels of data.  24 words per channel, starting at address 0x0180

;Source 1 address.  The address of the first electrode.  Must be a
number between 0 and 127,
                            corresponding to the "address" column in the
channel mapping document.
;Source 1 gain        Gain for first electrode.  Must be between -32767
and 32767.
                             Unity gain is 16384
;Source 2 address
;Source 2 gain
                              Note that because the gain is bipolar,
channels may be subtracted or summed.
                            Typically, the source 1 gains will be in the
neighborhood of 16384, +/- a few
                            percent, which is determined by
calibration.  To subtract out a reference channel,
                            set source 2 gain to -16384, +/- a few
percent.

                            Follows the coefficients (a0, a1, a2, b1,
b2) for the two biquads, arbitrarily called
                            "LPF" and "HPF" although they are coded
generically in the DSP, so either slot may
                            have either kind of filter, as well as
bandpass and band-reject filters.  All of the
                            coefficients are longs, with the low word in
the low address, and can generated with
                            MATLAB code, or any other program capable of
doing simple trig to 32-bit accuracy.
;LPF a2 lo, hi
;LPF a1 lo, hi
;LPF a0 lo, hi
;LPF b2 lo, hi
;LPF b1 lo, hi
;HPF a2 lo, hi
;HPF a1 lo, hi
;HPF a0 lo, hi
;HPF b2 lo, hi
;HPF b1 lo, hi

For the master DSP, the first set of coefficients corresponds to DAC0,
and the second set to DAC1.  The rest are unused.
At the moment, only the first 24 channels are working.  The last 8 await
code optimization.
