SPIKE_MPEG_HOWTO

spike_fixpos contains a modified version of the Berkeley mpeg_play mpeg
player.  

spike_fixpos requires util.c video.c parseblock.c motionvector.c decoders.c
readfile.c jrevdct.c and the associated header files, but not the various
dithering routines, as the image is grayscale.

video.c and util.c were modified to remove references to quietFlag,
DoDitherImage, ExecuteDisplay and SeekStream
